Welcome to the data portal for the 2017 Cell Reports paper [Developmental Emergence of Adult Neural Stem Cells as Revealed by Single-Cell Transcriptional Profiling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.017) by Yuzwa *et al.*, brought to you by [scClustViz](https://baderlab.github.io/scClustViz).  These are embryonic day 11.5 cortically-derived cells.  
Other datasets:	[E13.5 Cerebral Cortex](https://innesbt.shinyapps.io/e13cortex/); [E15.5 Cerebral Cortex](https://innesbt.shinyapps.io/e15cortex/); [E17.5 Cerebral Cortex](https://innesbt.shinyapps.io/e17cortex/)  

Currently this dataset is being used to demo an updated version of scClustViz with differential expression testing between user-selected sets of cells (beta version).  This is done by designating the cells per set (see panel at bottom of the page), then after calculations are complete, the comparison is stored as another cluster resolution that can be selected from the pulldown menu in the first panel.
